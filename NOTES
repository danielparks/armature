Splitting it up into prepare and activate steps means that branches and tags can't be updated as we go along. That also means:
  - That information has to be tracked in memory, so that two references to a new branch don't result in two objects.
  - Garbage collection must not collect those objects between the prepare and activate steps, even though a process likely won't be running to hold a lock on them.

Need to be able to get environments from branches.

Need to deal with deleted refs.

It might make sense to run our own webhook, rather than relying on a wrapper like Jenkins.
