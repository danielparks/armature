Need a garbage collector
 - probably just use a global lock
 - mv objects into trash directory and delete them in other thread (or after GC lock released)

Maybe don't check branch for update every run. Have a separate run that checks branches for updates (gofer branch-update)

Splitting it up into prepare and activate steps means that branches and tags can't be updated as we go along. That also means:
  - That information has to be tracked in memory, so that two references to a new branch don't result in two objects.
  - Garbage collection must not collect those objects between the prepare and activate steps, even though a process likely won't be running to hold a lock on them.
